{"name":"Droxit","body":"Droxit (DROpboX + gIT) is a tool for creating Git repositories quickly on your mac that is pushable to a remote in Dropbox.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nClone or download the Droxit repository first.\r\n\r\nMake sure the file is executable:\r\n\r\n    $ chmod 0777 /path/to/droxit.sh\r\n\r\nLink it to your /usr/local/bin\r\n\r\n    $ ln -s /path/to/droxit.sh /usr/local/bin/droxit\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a new repository called `test_repo`, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n    $ droxit test_repo\r\n\r\nThis will create a git repository, as well as a bare git repository in your ~/Dropbox/git/test_repo.git/ directory. Your local git repository will also have a remote called `dropbox` that points to your newly created Dropbox directory.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to make any changes to your repository locally, and then push the commits like this:\r\n\r\n    $ git push dropbox master\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n[Fahad Ibnay Heylaal](http://fahad19.com)","tagline":"create and sync Git repositories with Dropbox","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
